# PathfindingVisualizer


Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! This website lets us visualize some famous pathfinding algorithms.

## Algorithms Used

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
(weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

### A* Search 
Weighted algorithm, uses heuristics function to find path, guarantees the shortest path.

### Greedy Best-first Search
Weighted algorithm a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*, which does not guarantee the shortest path

### Breadth First Search
Unweighted algorithm, guarantees the shortest path

### Depth First Search
Unweighted algorithm, does not guarantee the shortest path
